🤣 Yeah, **welcome to email**, my friend — it’s the one protocol that still feels like it escaped from 1995 and somehow runs the world.
You’ve officially hit the “why is this so dumb” wall, and everyone who builds inbound email automation hits it too.

Let’s reset and look at this calmly — there *is* a clean way through it.

---

## 🧩 The Core Problem

You’ve now got the correct insight:

> “If I use `inbound.loctelli.com` for both inbound and outbound, everything routes cleanly — but I lose visibility into conversations like I would in a normal mailbox.”

Exactly. Because Postmark isn’t an email inbox — it’s just a **transactional mail pipe**. It receives → posts to webhook → you store and render.
So *you* are responsible for persisting and visualizing message history.

---

## ✅ The Proper Architecture (production-grade, no hacks)

Let’s stop fighting email and just own the flow.

### 1️⃣ All mail (inbound and outbound) goes through Postmark

* `From`: `ai@inbound.loctelli.com`
* `Reply-To`: `ai@inbound.loctelli.com`
* MX: `inbound.loctelli.com → Postmark`
* Webhook: your app receives every inbound message

→ Now Postmark is your transport layer, not your inbox.

---

### 2️⃣ Your app becomes the **source of truth**

When Postmark POSTs to your webhook, you:

* Save the inbound message to your database (user, thread, timestamp, body, attachments, headers).
* When you send a reply, you also log that outbound message to the same thread.

Now you can view full conversation history in your app — your own mini Gmail, basically.

Something like:

| Message | Direction | Body                   |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| User →  | inbound   | “Hey can you help me?” |
| AI →    | outbound  | “Sure, here’s how…”    |
| User →  | inbound   | “Thanks!”              |
| AI →    | outbound  | “You’re welcome!”      |

That’s how every SaaS support platform (like Front, Intercom, etc.) does it behind the scenes — they’re all just storing inbound/outbound message JSONs in a DB.

---

### 3️⃣ Optional: mirror to a “real” mailbox (for humans)

If you or your team *still* want to see conversations in a real inbox (like Gmail or Helpdesk), just BCC yourself when you send via Postmark.
Example:

```js
await postmark.sendEmail({
  From: "ai@inbound.loctelli.com",
  To: user.email,
  Bcc: "archive@loctelli.com",
  Subject: "Re: Your inquiry",
  TextBody: aiResponse,
});
```

Now you’ve got a human-readable backup of every message thread if you ever want to peek at it — but your system is the actual “truth.”

### 💡 TL;DR

| Goal                          | Best approach                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Clean routing, stable headers | Send and receive from `inbound.loctelli.com`   |
| View history                  | Store all inbound/outbound messages in your DB |
| Want human visibility         | BCC to an archive inbox                        |

---

### 🧠 The Mindset Shift

Stop thinking “email inbox.” Think **event log**.
Email just becomes a transport — your webhook and DB are the real conversation system.

---

If you want, I can show you a simple Postgres schema + webhook handler that implements this “conversation store” pattern — takes Postmark inbound events + outbound sends and turns them into a fully queryable message history.
Would you want that?
