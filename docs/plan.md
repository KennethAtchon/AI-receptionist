First I want to add AI controlling a phone number and email:

Yes, it is **entirely possible** to have an AI fully control both a **phone number** and an **email address** programmatically — including initiating, receiving, and responding to **calls, SMS, and emails** — using code and APIs. This is commonly done in automation, customer service bots, virtual assistants, and AI agents.

Below is a breakdown of **how to implement each**, **what's required**, and **which is harder**.

---

### 1. **AI Controlling a Phone Number (Calls + SMS)**

#### Capabilities:
- **Initiate calls** → Yes
- **Receive & answer calls** → Yes
- **Send SMS** → Yes
- **Receive & reply to SMS** → Yes

#### How to Implement (with code):
Use a **VoIP / programmable telephony API**:

| Provider | Features | SDKs |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Twilio** | Full SMS + Voice (programmable) | Python, Node.js, etc. |
| **Vonage (Nexmo)** | Same | All major languages |
| **Plivo**, **Telnyx**, **SignalWire** | Same | Yes |

##### Example: Twilio (Python)
```python
from twilio.rest import Client
from flask import Flask, request
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse

account_sid = 'your_sid'
auth_token = 'your_token'
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# SEND SMS
client.messages.create(
    to='+1234567890',
    from_='+1987654321',  # Your Twilio number
    body='Hello from AI!'
)

# RECEIVE SMS (webhook)
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/sms', methods=['POST'])
def sms_reply():
    resp = twilio.twiml.MessagingResponse()
    resp.message("AI received: " + request.values['Body'])
    return str(resp)

# MAKE CALL
call = client.calls.create(
    twiml='<Response><Say>Hello from AI!</Say></Response>',
    to='+1234567890',
    from_='+1987654321'
)

# ANSWER INCOMING CALL
@app.route('/voice', methods=['POST'])
def voice():
    resp = VoiceResponse()
    resp.say("Hello, this is your AI assistant.", voice='alice')
    resp.pause(length=1)
    resp.say("How can I help you today?")
    return str(resp)
```

> Your AI can **listen to speech**, **transcribe**, **understand intent**, and **respond in voice** using speech synthesis (e.g., Twilio `<Say>`, ElevenLabs, or Google TTS).

#### Requirements:
- Buy a phone number (~$1/month)
- Set up webhooks (public URL or ngrok for testing)
- Handle real-time events
- Use STT/TTS for voice interaction

### 2. **AI Controlling an Email Address**

#### Capabilities:
- **Send emails** → Yes
- **Receive emails** → Yes (via polling or webhooks)
- **Auto-reply** → Yes

#### How to Implement (with code):

##### Option A: Use Gmail API (OAuth2)
```python
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import email
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
import base64

# SEND EMAIL
service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
message = MIMEText('Hello from AI!')
message['to'] = 'user@example.com'
message['from'] = 'me'
message['subject'] = 'AI Message'
raw = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(message.as_bytes()).decode()
service.users().messages().send(userId='me', body={'raw': raw}).execute()

# RECEIVE & REPLY (poll inbox)
def check_inbox():
    results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', q='is:unread').execute()
    messages = results.get('messages', [])
    for msg in messages:
        msg_data = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=m.get('id')).execute()
        # Parse, process with AI, reply...
```

> **Limitation**: Gmail API requires OAuth, no real-time push unless using **Pub/Sub**.

##### Option B: Use IMAP/SMTP (any email)
```python
import imaplib
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# SEND
msg = MIMEText("AI response")
msg['Subject'] = 'Re: Your message'
msg['From'] = 'ai@yourdomain.com'
msg['To'] = 'user@gmail.com'

with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
    server.starttls()
    server.login('ai@yourdomain.com', 'app_password')
    server.send_message(msg)

# RECEIVE (IMAP)
with imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com') as mail:
    mail.login('ai@yourdomain.com', 'app_password')
    mail.select('inbox')
    status, messages = mail.search(None, 'UNSEEN')
    # Process each...
```

##### Option C: Use **custom domain + email provider API**
- **Resend**, **Mailgun**, **SendGrid**, **Postmark**
- Full inbound + outbound webhooks

```python
# Mailgun example (inbound webhook)
@app.route('/mailgun', methods=['POST'])
def mailgun_webhook():
    sender = request.form['sender']
    body = request.form['body-plain']
    # AI processes → send reply via Mailgun API
```

#### Requirements:
- Email account (Gmail, custom domain, etc.)
- App passwords or OAuth
- Webhook or polling loop
- Handle attachments, HTML, threading

### Comparison: Which is **Harder** to Implement?

| Feature | **Phone Number (Twilio etc.)** | **Email** |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| **Setup** | Buy number, set webhook | Create account, enable API |
| **Real-time receive** | Yes (webhooks) | Partial (webhooks rare, usually poll) |
| **Voice interaction** | Yes (TTS/STT) | No |
| **Media (images, files)** | MMS possible | Yes (attachments) |
| **Spam / compliance** | High (TCPA, carrier rules) | High (CAN-SPAM, DMARC) |
| **Cost** | ~$1–2/month + usage | Free (Gmail) or ~$1/domain |
| **Complexity** | **Higher** | Lower |

---

### Verdict: **Phone Number Control is HARDER**

#### Why?
1. **Real-time bidirectional voice** requires:
   - WebSockets or streaming
   - STT/TTS integration
   - Low latency
2. **Telephony compliance** (TCPA, Do-Not-Call, consent)
3. **Carrier filtering** (SMS spam, 10DLC registration in US)
4. **More moving parts**: audio, call states, timeouts

#### Email is easier because:
- Mostly **text-based**
- **Asynchronous**
- Easier parsing
- Fewer compliance landmines (if you follow CAN-SPAM)

### Recommended Stack for AI Agent

```text
AI Brain (LLM) ↔ Backend (Python/FastAPI)
        ↓
Twilio → SMS + Voice (real-time)
Mailgun → Email (webhook)
Database → Track conversations
```

---

### Summary

| Feature | Possible? | Harder? |
|-------|---------|--------|
| AI controls **phone number** (calls + SMS) | Yes | **Harder** |
| AI controls **email** | Yes | Easier |

> **Start with email** → then add phone once email AI agent works.

Let me know if you want a **full working repo template** (FastAPI + Twilio + Mailgun + LLM).

-----------

So we just want something to sit there and listen for events and respond. We use our current SDK to do this.

Verify that all core resource, aside from text, are independent and only need to be called once, and thats like this is just an example the naming is bad: .setsession(phone), this will make the AI listen for calls and take calls, and lsiten for SMS and take sms from that number
For email basically the same thing
For text, its like the thats truly for dev, in a sense where they can manage it to my degree

How We will set it up:

Twilio - calls and sms
Resend only (for now, delete the SMTP and SendGrid configs), if resend doesnt work, can delete and create another

Both twilio and resend will use webhooks:

8. Configure Twilio (Dashboard)

Go to Twilio Console
Buy a phone number (or use existing)
Click your number → Messaging → A MESSAGE COMES IN → Webhook
→ Paste: https://abc123.ngrok.io/sms → HTTP POST
Voice → A CALL COMES IN → Webhook
→ Paste: https://abc123.ngrok.io/voice → HTTP POST


Help me create a plan on how to do this refractor. The consumer package just needs to setup the webhooks (they will provide their own webhooks to us)
We handle the webhook and make sure everything runs
