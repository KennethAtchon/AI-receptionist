We need a MCP + Function calling hybrid architecture. The current architecture, I think it treats everything as a "tool" which means a function call, I want tools to act as both a MCP tool and a Function call tool. This will be another refractor to the SDK, and a aim to achieve my vision of it. We need this clearly defined and works well.
