Need to setup twilio for calls and sms and test its inbound
Need to look at optimization the package to work with servers like loctelli (Objects vs static), how to build an sdk that works for servers? what pattern should it be like should the server have to change the sdk or only needs to set it up once and change throughout? What would happen if server needs to handle multiple requests concurrently? need to make sdk parallelizable
Need a way to send bulk-emails with postmark
